\# Transaction Ledger



A simple Java project that simulates a transaction ledger system.



The goal of this project is to practice building a small backend-style application

that records transactions, calculates balances, and allows querying transaction history.



This project is intentionally simple and focuses on:

\- clean code

\- basic data structures

\- separation of concerns

\- writing understandable logic without frameworks



\## Features (planned)

\- Create credit and debit transactions

\- Store transactions in memory

\- Calculate account balance

\- View transaction history

\- Basic input validation



\## Why this project?

This project was built to strengthen core Java fundamentals and demonstrate

practical problem-solving without relying on libraries or frameworks.
